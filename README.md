Scheduling the right nursing staff will improve the performance and quality of the nursing unit. 
Proper scheduling will help recruitment, nurse preferences, and maintain an overtime budget for a logical nurse.
The most important thing in scheduling is increasing the nurse's spirit and ensuring patient safety. 
NSP can be solved by using many methods, one of them is using a genetic algorithm (GA), GA is an effective and optimal method in solving nurse scheduling problems. The
results obtained is an optimal schedule that is the schedule does not violate the rules that have been determined by the hospital and the constraints of nurses as well( ex, nurses cant have a night shift followed by a morning shift) , we run it on a simple model of 20 nurses.
